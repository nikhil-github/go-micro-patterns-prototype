# Foundation Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The foundation module has been refactored to follow better separation of concerns and provide a more flexible architecture for microservices.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed ConnectRPCServer from Core Foundation

**Before:**
- `ConnectRPCServer` was tightly coupled to the foundation core
- Every microservice was forced to use the same HTTP server implementation
- Hardcoded `:8080` address and HTTP-only approach
- Violated Single Responsibility Principle

**After:**
- Foundation focuses only on cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, tracing)
- HTTP server is now a separate, optional server
- Microservices can choose their own transport protocols
- Better separation of concerns

### 2. New Architecture

#### Core Foundation (`foundation/app.go`)
- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Logging, metrics, tracing, configuration
- **Lifecycle management**: Start/stop coordination for servers
- **Dependency injection**: Provides common services to business logic
- **Server registry**: Allows adding custom servers via `AddServer()`

#### ConnectRPC Server (`foundation/connectrpc/server.go`)
- **Separate module**: Optional HTTP server for ConnectRPC
- **Configurable**: Address, name, and logger can be customized
- **Lifecycle managed**: Implements the `Server` interface
- **Flexible**: Can be used or replaced by microservices

### 3. Updated Usage Pattern

**Before:**
```go
app := foundation.New()
server := app.ConnectRPCServer()
server.RegisterHandler(path, handler)
app.Start(ctx)
```

**After:**
```go
app := foundation.New()
server := connectrpc.NewServer("my-service", ":8080", app.Logger())
server.RegisterHandler(path, handler)
app.AddServer(server)
app.Start(ctx)
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Better Separation of Concerns**
- Foundation handles cross-cutting concerns only
- Transport layer is separate and optional
- Each microservice can choose its own server implementation

### 2. **Increased Flexibility**
- Support for different transport protocols (HTTP, gRPC, etc.)
- Configurable server addresses and settings
- Microservices can use multiple servers if needed

### 3. **Improved Testability**
- Foundation can be tested without HTTP server dependencies
- Server implementations can be mocked or replaced
- Clear interfaces make unit testing easier

### 4. **Enhanced Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused modules
- Clear responsibilities
- Easier to extend and modify

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Microservices

1. **Update imports**: Add `"github.com/yourusername/foundation/connectrpc"`
2. **Create server**: Use `connectrpc.NewServer()` instead of `app.ConnectRPCServer()`
3. **Register server**: Call `app.AddServer(server)` to add to lifecycle management
4. **No other changes needed**: All other foundation APIs remain the same

### Example Migration

```go
// Before
app := foundation.New()
server := app.ConnectRPCServer()
server.RegisterHandler(path, handler)
app.Start(ctx)

// After
app := foundation.New()
server := connectrpc.NewServer("my-service", ":8080", app.Logger())
server.RegisterHandler(path, handler)
app.AddServer(server)
app.Start(ctx)
```

## Type Aliases

The foundation package now exports type aliases for better usability:

```go
type Logger = logging.Logger
type Tracer = tracing.Tracer
type Metrics = metrics.Metrics
type Span = tracing.Span
type SpanOption = tracing.SpanOption
```

## Interface Naming

The interface has been renamed from `Service` to `Server` to better reflect its purpose:

```go
// Server represents a lifecycle-managed server component
// (e.g., HTTP servers, gRPC servers) that can be started and stopped.
type Server interface {
	Start(ctx context.Context) error
	Stop(ctx context.Context) error
	Name() string
}
```

This makes the API more explicit and clear about what types of components can be managed by the foundation.

## Future Enhancements

This refactoring enables several future improvements:

1. **Multiple transport protocols**: gRPC, WebSocket, etc.
2. **Service discovery integration**: Easy to add service registration
3. **Health checks**: Can be added as separate servers
4. **Configuration management**: More flexible configuration options
5. **Plugin architecture**: Easy to add new server types

## Testing

All examples and the user-service have been updated and tested:
- ✅ `foundation/examples/simple-usage`
- ✅ `foundation/examples/user-service`
- ✅ `user-service/cmd/main.go`

All components build successfully and maintain the same functionality while providing better architecture.
