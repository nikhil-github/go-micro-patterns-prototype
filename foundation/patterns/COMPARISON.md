# Service Factory Pattern Comparison

This document compares five different approaches to microservice service management, each with its own trade-offs.

## Pattern Overview

### 1. Current Pattern: Comprehensive ServiceFactory
**Location**: `patterns/current/`

**Approach**: Single comprehensive factory that handles everything
- Logger initialization
- Config management  
- Service creation
- Context management
- Lifecycle orchestration
- Signal handling

**Usage**:
```go
factory := servicefactory.NewServiceFactory()
factory.Build()
factory.CreateConnectRPCServer(handler)
factory.StartAll()
factory.WaitForShutdown()
```

**Pros**:
- Single entry point for everything
- Automatic service registration
- Built-in context management
- Graceful shutdown handling

**Cons**:
- Mixed responsibilities
- Complex API with multiple steps
- Hard to test individual components
- Hidden dependencies (auto-registration)

---

### 2. Builder Pattern: Method Chaining
**Location**: `patterns/builder/`

**Approach**: Fluent interface with method chaining for explicit configuration

**Usage**:
```go
app := builder.NewMicroservice().
    WithLogger(logger).
    AddConnectRPCServer(handler).
    Build().
    Start()

app.WaitForShutdown()
```

**Pros**:
- Explicit and readable API
- Method chaining for better flow
- Clear separation of configuration and execution
- Easy to understand what's happening

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation
- Multiple objects to manage
- Potential for long chains

---

### 3. Separated Concerns: Modular Components
**Location**: `patterns/separated/`

**Approach**: Separate, focused components for each responsibility with full configuration management

**Usage**:
```go
// Config management
cfg := config.New().Load()

// Service creation
factory := services.NewFactory(logger)
service := factory.CreateConnectRPCServer(cfg.ConnectRPC, handler)

// Lifecycle management
orchestrator := lifecycle.NewOrchestrator(logger)
orchestrator.Add(service)
orchestrator.Start()
orchestrator.WaitForShutdown()
```

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual components
- Highly modular and reusable
- Explicit dependencies
- Full configuration management

**Cons**:
- More boilerplate code
- Multiple objects to manage
- Need to understand multiple components

---

### 4. Simple: Direct Service Creation + Orchestrator
**Location**: `patterns/simple/`

**Approach**: Most minimal approach - create services directly, no factories or config management

**Usage**:
```go
// Create service directly (no factory needed)
service := services.NewConnectRPCServer(":8080", handler, logger)

// Simple orchestrator for lifecycle
orchestrator := orchestrator.New(logger)
orchestrator.Add(service)
orchestrator.Start()
orchestrator.WaitForShutdown()
```

**Pros**:
- Extremely simple and minimal
- No abstractions or factories
- Direct service creation
- Easy to understand and use
- Minimal boilerplate

**Cons**:
- No configuration management
- Manual service creation
- Less reusable
- Hardcoded values

---

### 5. Simplified Pattern: Focused ServiceFactory
**Location**: `patterns/simplified/`

**Approach**: Simplified version of current pattern with separated config and explicit dependencies

**Usage**:
```go
// Load config (separated concern)
cfg := config.Load()

// Create factory with explicit dependencies
factory := servicefactory.New(cfg, logger)

// Add services explicitly
handler := servicefactory.NewDummyHandler()
factory.AddConnectRPCServer(handler)

// Run everything (start + wait for shutdown)
factory.Run()
```

**Pros**:
- Better testability than current pattern
- Explicit dependencies
- Separated config management
- Simplified API
- Single entry point benefit
- Focused responsibilities

**Cons**:
- Still single factory (less modular than separated)
- Slightly more boilerplate than current
- Not as flexible as separated pattern

## Key Differences Between Separated and Simple

| Aspect | Separated | Simple |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Config Management** | Full viper-based config | Hardcoded values |
| **Service Creation** | Factory pattern | Direct creation |
| **Packages** | 3 packages (config, services, lifecycle) | 2 packages (services, orchestrator) |
| **Flexibility** | High - configurable | Low - hardcoded |
| **Complexity** | Medium | Very Low |
| **Reusability** | High | Low |

## Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | Current | Builder | Separated | Simple | Simplified |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Simplicity** | Medium | High | Low | Very High | High |
| **Flexibility** | Low | Medium | High | Low | Medium |
| **Testability** | Low | Medium | High | High | High |
| **Maintainability** | Medium | High | Very High | High | High |
| **Learning Curve** | Medium | Low | High | Very Low | Low |
| **Boilerplate** | Low | Medium | High | Very Low | Low |
| **Explicit Control** | Low | Medium | High | High | High |
| **Configuration** | Built-in | Builder-based | Full viper | None | Separated |

## Code Complexity Analysis

### Lines of Code (main.go)
- **Current**: 50 lines
- **Builder**: 15 lines  
- **Separated**: 25 lines
- **Simple**: 20 lines
- **Simplified**: 25 lines

### Number of Packages
- **Current**: 2 packages
- **Builder**: 3 packages
- **Separated**: 3 packages  
- **Simple**: 2 packages
- **Simplified**: 2 packages

### API Surface Area
- **Current**: 8 methods on ServiceFactory
- **Builder**: 6 methods on Builder + 4 on Microservice
- **Separated**: 3 focused APIs (config, factory, orchestrator)
- **Simple**: 2 focused APIs (services, orchestrator)
- **Simplified**: 4 methods on ServiceFactory + config.Load()

## Recommendations

### Choose Current Pattern if:
- You want a single, comprehensive solution
- You prefer less boilerplate
- You don't need fine-grained control
- You're building a simple microservice

### Choose Builder Pattern if:
- You want a readable, fluent API
- You prefer explicit configuration
- You want good balance of simplicity and flexibility
- You're building medium-complexity services

### Choose Separated Pattern if:
- You need maximum flexibility and testability
- You're building complex microservices
- You want to reuse components
- You prefer explicit dependencies
- You need full configuration management

### Choose Simple Pattern if:
- You want maximum simplicity
- You prefer explicit control
- You're building simple services
- You want minimal learning curve
- You don't need configuration management

### Choose Simplified Pattern if:
- You want the benefits of current pattern but better testability
- You prefer explicit dependencies over hidden ones
- You want to separate config management from service creation
- You need to test individual components
- You're building production systems that need maintainability

## Testing Each Pattern

You can test each pattern by running:

```bash
# Current pattern
cd patterns/current && go run main.go

# Builder pattern  
cd patterns/builder && go run main.go

# Separated pattern
cd patterns/separated && go run main.go

# Simple pattern
cd patterns/simple && go run main.go

# Simplified pattern
cd patterns/simplified && go run main.go
```

## Conclusion

Each pattern has its place depending on your specific needs:

- **Current**: Good for simple, quick development
- **Builder**: Good balance for most use cases
- **Separated**: Best for complex, production systems with full config
- **Simple**: Best for learning, prototyping, and simple services
- **Simplified**: Best middle ground - current pattern benefits with better testability

The choice depends on your team's preferences, project complexity, and maintenance requirements.
