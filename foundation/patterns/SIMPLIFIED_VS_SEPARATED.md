# Simplified vs Separated Pattern Comparison

This document provides a detailed comparison between the **Simplified** (Focused ServiceFactory) and **Separated** (Modular Components) patterns, helping you choose the right approach for your microservices.

## Quick Summary

| Aspect | Simplified Pattern | Separated Pattern |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | Low - single factory + config | Medium - 3 focused components |
| **Learning Curve** | Low - 2 packages to understand | Medium - 3 components to learn |
| **Testability** | High - test config and factory separately | Very High - test each component independently |
| **Maintainability** | High - focused responsibilities | Very High - single responsibility principle |
| **Multi-service Consistency** | High - same factory everywhere | Very High - same patterns everywhere |
| **Extensibility** | Medium - add to factory or config | High - add new components without touching existing |
| **API Surface** | 4 methods + config.Load() | 3 focused APIs |

## Simplified Pattern: Focused ServiceFactory

### Structure
```
patterns/simplified/
├── config/             # Configuration management
├── servicefactory/     # Focused service factory
└── main.go            # Usage example
```

### API
```go
// Load config (separated concern)
cfg := config.Load()

// Create logger from config
logger := cfg.CreateLogger()

// Create factory with explicit dependencies
factory := servicefactory.New(cfg, logger)

// Add services explicitly
handler := servicefactory.NewDummyHandler()
factory.AddConnectRPCServer(handler)

// Run everything (start + wait for shutdown)
factory.Run()
```

### Pros
- **Single entry point**: One factory handles everything
- **Explicit dependencies**: Config and logger injected clearly
- **Good testability**: Can test config and factory separately
- **Simple API**: Only 4 methods to learn
- **Logger configuration**: Full env-based logger config
- **Less boilerplate**: Fewer objects to manage
- **Quick setup**: Same pattern across services

### Cons
- **Still single factory**: Less modular than separated
- **Mixed responsibilities**: Factory handles service creation + lifecycle
- **Harder to extend**: Adding new services requires factory changes
- **Less flexible**: Can't mix and match components

## Separated Pattern: Modular Components

### Structure
```
patterns/separated/
├── config/             # Configuration management
├── services/           # Service factory
├── lifecycle/          # Lifecycle orchestrator
└── main.go            # Usage example
```

### API
```go
// Config management
cfg := config.New().Load()

// Service creation
factory := services.NewFactory(logger)
service := factory.CreateConnectRPCServer(cfg.ConnectRPC, handler)

// Lifecycle management
orchestrator := lifecycle.NewOrchestrator(logger)
orchestrator.Add(service)
orchestrator.Start()
orchestrator.WaitForShutdown()
```

### Pros
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each component has one job
- **Maximum testability**: Test each component independently
- **Highly modular**: Mix and match components
- **Easy to extend**: Add new components without touching existing
- **Explicit dependencies**: Clear what depends on what
- **Reusable components**: Use across different microservices
- **Team collaboration**: Different teams can work on different components

### Cons
- **More boilerplate**: More lines of code per service
- **Higher learning curve**: Need to understand 3 components
- **More objects to manage**: Explicit dependency management
- **More complex setup**: Multiple steps to get started

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. **API Complexity**

**Simplified Pattern**: ✅ Simpler API
```go
// 4 methods to learn
factory := servicefactory.New(cfg, logger)
factory.AddConnectRPCServer(handler)
factory.Run()
```

**Separated Pattern**: ❌ More complex API
```go
// 3 components, multiple methods
cfg := config.New().Load()
factory := services.NewFactory(logger)
service := factory.CreateConnectRPCServer(cfg, handler)
orchestrator := lifecycle.NewOrchestrator(logger)
orchestrator.Add(service)
orchestrator.Start()
orchestrator.WaitForShutdown()
```

### 2. **Testability**

**Simplified Pattern**: ✅ Good testability
```go
// Test config separately
func TestConfig(t *testing.T) {
    cfg := config.Load()
    assert.Equal(t, ":8080", cfg.ConnectRPC.Address)
}

// Test factory with mock config
func TestFactory(t *testing.T) {
    cfg := &config.Config{ConnectRPC: config.ConnectRPC{Address: ":8080"}}
    factory := servicefactory.New(cfg, logger)
    // Test factory methods...
}
```

**Separated Pattern**: ✅ Excellent testability
```go
// Test each component independently
func TestConfig(t *testing.T) {
    cfg := config.New().Load()
    assert.Equal(t, ":8080", cfg.ConnectRPC.Address)
}

func TestServiceFactory(t *testing.T) {
    factory := services.NewFactory(logger)
    service := factory.CreateConnectRPCServer(cfg, handler)
    assert.NotNil(t, service)
}

func TestOrchestrator(t *testing.T) {
    orchestrator := lifecycle.NewOrchestrator(logger)
    orchestrator.Add(mockService)
    assert.NoError(t, orchestrator.Start())
}
```

### 3. **Extensibility**

**Simplified Pattern**: ❌ Harder to extend
```go
// Adding a new service type requires factory changes
func (sf *ServiceFactory) AddDatabase(config DatabaseConfig) {
    // Must modify the factory
    // Must update tests
    // Must update documentation
}
```

**Separated Pattern**: ✅ Easy to extend
```go
// Add new service type without touching existing code
func (f *Factory) CreateDatabase(cfg config.Database) services.Service {
    return database.NewServer(cfg, f.logger)
}

// Existing code unchanged
// No factory modifications needed
// Easy to test new component
```

### 4. **Multi-service Consistency**

**Simplified Pattern**: ✅ High consistency
```go
// Service A
cfg := config.Load()
factory := servicefactory.New(cfg, logger)
factory.AddConnectRPCServer(handler)
factory.Run()

// Service B - same pattern
cfg := config.Load()
factory := servicefactory.New(cfg, logger)
factory.AddConnectRPCServer(handler)
factory.Run()
```

**Separated Pattern**: ✅ Very high consistency
```go
// Service A
cfg := config.New().Load()
factory := services.NewFactory(logger)
service := factory.CreateConnectRPCServer(cfg.ConnectRPC, handler)
orchestrator := lifecycle.NewOrchestrator(logger)
orchestrator.Add(service)
orchestrator.Start()
orchestrator.WaitForShutdown()

// Service B - exact same pattern
cfg := config.New().Load()
factory := services.NewFactory(logger)
service := factory.CreateConnectRPCServer(cfg.ConnectRPC, handler)
orchestrator := lifecycle.NewOrchestrator(logger)
orchestrator.Add(service)
orchestrator.Start()
orchestrator.WaitForShutdown()
```

### 5. **Team Collaboration**

**Simplified Pattern**: ❌ Single point of contention
- One team owns the factory
- Changes affect all services
- Merge conflicts on factory changes

**Separated Pattern**: ✅ Parallel development
- Team A works on config management
- Team B works on service factories
- Team C works on lifecycle management
- Teams can work independently

### 6. **Learning Curve**

**Simplified Pattern**: ✅ Low learning curve
- Learn 2 packages: config and servicefactory
- 4 methods to remember
- Simple flow: config → factory → run

**Separated Pattern**: ❌ Higher learning curve
- Learn 3 packages: config, services, lifecycle
- Multiple methods across components
- More complex flow: config → factory → orchestrator → start → wait

## Recommendations

### Choose Simplified Pattern if:
- You want a single entry point with good testability
- You prefer explicit dependencies over hidden ones
- You want to separate config management from service creation
- You need configurable logging via environment variables
- You're building medium-complexity microservices
- You want a balance between simplicity and testability
- You have a small team working on all services

### Choose Separated Pattern if:
- You need maximum flexibility and testability
- You're building complex microservices with many dependencies
- You want to reuse components across services
- You prefer explicit control and dependencies
- You have multiple teams working on different parts
- You need to enforce consistent patterns across services
- You're building production systems that need to scale
- You want to add new service types without touching existing code

## Real-world Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Team, Simple Services

- Less learning overhead
- Good enough testability
- Single entry point benefit

### Scenario 2: Large Team, Complex Services
**Recommendation**: Separated Pattern
- Parallel development
- Maximum testability
- Component reuse
- Clear boundaries

### Scenario 3: Production System with Multiple Services
**Recommendation**: Separated Pattern

## Conclusion

Both patterns are excellent choices, but they serve different needs:

- **Simplified Pattern**: Best for teams that want a single entry point with good testability and explicit dependencies. Great middle ground between current and separated patterns.

- **Separated Pattern**: Best for teams that need maximum flexibility, testability, and component reuse. Ideal for complex, production systems with multiple teams.

The choice depends on your team size, project complexity, and maintenance requirements. If you're unsure, start with the **Simplified Pattern** and migrate to **Separated Pattern** as your needs grow.
